# Send Crypto

Send Crypto is a blockchain application built with React and Solidity. It allows users to send Ethereum through the Ethereum network by connecting to their MetaMask wallet.

## Features

- **Connect to MetaMask**: Pair the app with an Ethereum wallet.
- **Smart Contract**: Interact with a deployed contract written in Solidity.
- **Send Ethereum**: Initiate and confirm Ethereum transactions with MetaMask.

## How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet**: Click "Connect to Wallet" to pair with MetaMask.
2. **Switch Accounts**: Choose the Ethereum account to send Ethereum from.
3. **Send Transaction**: Input recipient address, amount, and message, then confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
